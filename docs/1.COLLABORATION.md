# COLLABORATION GUIDE: n8n Mermaid Nodes Project

## Overview

This project is an n8n community node package designed to provide Mermaid diagram generation capabilities within n8n workflows. It extends n8n's functionality by adding custom nodes that can create, manipulate, and export Mermaid diagrams including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and other diagram types. The main use cases include automated documentation generation, workflow visualization, data flow diagrams, and dynamic chart creation based on workflow data.

## Tools

### Tool: n8n

**Requirements**
- Node.js version 20.15 or higher
- npm package manager
- Global installation of n8n: `npm install n8n -g`

**Configurations n8n**
- `package.json` n8n section: Defines which nodes are registered with n8n (currently MermaidCli node)
- `nodes/MermaidCLI/MermaidCli.node.ts`: Main node implementation following n8n's INodeType interface
- `nodes/MermaidCLI/MermaidCli.node.json`: Node metadata for n8n registration and display properties

### Tool: TypeScript

**Requirements**
- TypeScript compiler (included in devDependencies)
- Node.js types and n8n workflow types

**Configurations TypeScript**
- `tsconfig.json`: Compilation settings targeting ES2019 with CommonJS modules for n8n compatibility
- `dist/`: Output directory for compiled JavaScript files

### Tool: Gulp

**Requirements**
- Gulp CLI (included in devDependencies)
- Node.js file system access

**Configurations Gulp**
- `gulpfile.js`: Asset copying tasks for node icons from nodes/MermaidCLI/ to dist directory

### Tool: Docker

## Setup & Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20.15 or higher)
- npm package manager
- git for version control
- n8n installed globally: `npm install n8n -g`
- Docker and Docker Compose (for testing environment)
- Chromium browser (for Mermaid CLI diagram rendering)
- Recommended: n8n development environment setup following official documentation

### Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Development Workflow

```sh
# Watch mode for TypeScript compilation
npm run dev

# Build the project (compile TypeScript and copy assets)
npm run build

# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
npm run lintfix

# Test in Docker environment
cd n8n_test_env
docker-compose -f compose.n8n-service.yaml up
```

## Build & Deployment

### Build

- **TypeScript Compilation**: `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript and copies icon assets to dist directory
- **Development Mode**: `npm run dev` - Runs TypeScript compiler in watch mode for active development
- **Asset Processing**: Gulp automatically copies SVG icons from nodes/MermaidCLI to dist folder
- **Automated Build**: `build-and-deploy.sh` - Comprehensive build and deployment script

### Deploy

Deploy for n8n community node registry:

```sh
# Prepare for publishing (build + lint)
npm run prepublishOnly

# Publish to npm registry
npm publish

# Automated deployment
./build-and-deploy.sh
```

For n8n cloud verification:
1. Ensure package is published to npm
2. Submit for verification through n8n's community node submission process
3. Follow n8n documentation for community node guidelines

## Debugging

### Debugging Strategy: Build error recovery

```sh
# Clean and rebuild
npx rimraf dist && npm run build

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Validate n8n node structure
npm run lint
```

### Debugging Strategy: Node development

```sh
# Test node locally in n8n
n8n start

# Run with development credentials
n8n start --tunnel

# Test in Docker environment
cd n8n_test_env
docker-compose -f compose.n8n-service.yaml up
```

**DEBUGGING: GOTCHAs AND RECOVERY**

- The ERROR: "Unexpected eof" (end of file) | Can typically mean there is a missing or extra bracket/parenthesis. However, can be some times caused by mis-aligned quote types (i.e. opening quote: \' while closing quote '") or additionally by missing tags. Please rewrite the given file to fix the error even if it looks correct. Mistakes happen.
- n8n Node Type Errors: Ensure INodeType interface is properly implemented with required description properties
- Mermaid CLI Execution Errors: Verify Chromium/Chrome browser is available and accessible for diagram rendering
- Docker Environment Issues: Check Docker containers have proper permissions and browser dependencies installed
- Icon Display Problems: Check that SVG files are in correct directories and gulp build task copies them to dist
- TypeScript Import Errors: Use n8n-workflow imports correctly and ensure all required types are imported
- Subprocess Execution Failures: Verify mermaid CLI (@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli) is properly installed and accessible

## Git Commit Best Practices

**Git Commands**

- Use the `git status` command to get a clear view of what you are updating.
- Add and commit your changes with a helpful message using `git add -A && git commit -m '[HELPFUL COMMIT MESSAGE HERE]'`

**Basic Rules**
- Git commits should be a wrapper for related changes. For example, fixing two different bugs should produce two separate commits. 
- Commit Often to keep your commits small to enable better reporting on changes and git history management.
- Don't Commit Half-Done Work, only commit code when a logical component is completed. Split a feature's implementation into logical chunks that can be completed quickly so that you can commit often.
- Test Your Code Before You Commit. Follow the Debugging Strategies.
Resist the temptation to commit something that you «think» is completed. Test it thoroughly by making sure the code builds.
- Write clear and Good Commit Messages and keep [.docs/CHANGELOG.md] is up to date. Begin your message with a short summary of your changes (up to 50 characters as a guideline). Separate it from the following body by including a blank line. The body of your message should provide detailed answers to the following questions: – What was the motivation for the change? – How does it differ from the previous implementation? Use the imperative, present tense («change», not «changed» or «changes») to be consistent with generated messages from commands like git merge.

## Collaboration Tips

- Keep node implementations focused and single-purpose for better maintainability
- Use clear, descriptive names for node properties and operations
- Document new nodes, credentials, and operations in the `.docs/` folder
- Test nodes thoroughly in n8n before committing changes
- Follow n8n's community node guidelines for consistency
- Update this guide as the project evolves and new Mermaid features are added
